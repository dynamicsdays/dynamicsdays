===========================

(adopted 18th Sept 1998, updated 27th September 2002)

1.    The European Dynamics Days Advisory Committee consists of at most 20 members. For the years 2003, 2004 and 2005, this will include one member appointed by the EPS Division in Statistical and Nonlinear Physics.
2.    The Advisory Committee can appoint new members with two thirds majority; candidates are nominated by the members of the Committee.
3.    Membership term for the members of the Committee is for a period of three consecutive European Dynamics Days, ending at the end of the third. Extensions for consecutive periods are possible by two thirds majority vote from all members.

After a proposal for the next meeting is accepted, the local organizing committee runs the Dynamics Days program until completion of the meeting, drawing upon the Advisory Committee as well as any other members selected by the local organizing committee as the advisory board for the meeting.
6.    In evaluating a proposal, the Committee places special emphasis on securing support for order of 20 or so worthy participants with no other means of support (Eastern and Central Europe in particular).
7.    The title "European Dynamics Days", the final decision to appoint organizers for the meeting for any given year and other issues related to the continuation and existence of European Dynamics Days remain with the Committee, to be decided by simple majority of those answering the secretary's opinion poll.
